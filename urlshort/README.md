# urlshort

URL shortner with data backstore supporting YAML, JSON, BoltDB.

Notable irritation may include but not limited to: 

- Commnad line argument does not makes sense. It will look for all the yaml, json and db file regardless of what you're actually running.

I'm trying not to fix them and move on to next exercises. Take them as TODO.
